SUBJECT : WEB DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND METHODS

Student Name: Sneha Rajendra Malshetti





 

Project Proposal:
Our application, as the heading suggests will serve as a platform for investors and venture capitalists to meet the startups that they would like to invest in. 
Roles  and Functions :
The venture capitalists/ investors can view the profiles of the different startups that have registered in the application.
The different startups can view the profile of the investors or venture capitalist that exist in the application
 Both parties can communicate and write a review for each other. For the sake of authentication, the admin has to accept the registration request of both parties. 
The admin can view all details of both parties and can add or delete or update the information of both roles.
The venture capitalists and startups must register using an initial registration fees.

POJOs’ :
The main POJO classes used will be as follows:
Investors
Startups 
Since it’s a many to many relationship, we will use a bridge table which tells us which venture capitalist invested how much in which company.
